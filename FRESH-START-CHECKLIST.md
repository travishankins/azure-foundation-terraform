# Fresh Start - Ready for Presentation Tomorrow

## ✅ Cleanup Complete

All demos have been cleaned up and are ready for a fresh start:

### What Was Removed:
- ✅ All `.terraform` directories
- ✅ All `terraform.tfstate` files
- ✅ All `.terraform.lock.hcl` files
- ✅ All Azure resources destroyed
- ✅ Storage account `tfstatebd7ovu` removed
- ✅ Resource group `rg-terraform-state` removed

### What Remains (Your Demo Code):
- ✅ All 6 demo directories with working Terraform code
- ✅ All README.md files with instructor dialogue
- ✅ Backend configuration files (backend.hcl)
- ✅ Variable files (tfvars)
- ✅ All supporting documentation

---

## 🎯 Tomorrow's Presentation Flow

### Pre-Demo Setup (5 minutes before)
```bash
# 1. Verify Azure login
az login
az account show

# 2. Optional: Set default location if needed
export ARM_LOCATION="East US"
```

---

### Demo 1: Local State (5 min)
**No backend needed - runs standalone**

```bash
cd demo-01-local-state
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
terraform output
terraform destroy  # Optional - clean up after demo
```

**Key Points:**
- Show local terraform.tfstate file
- Explain limitations (single user, no collaboration)
- Transition: "This is fine for learning, but for teams..."

---

### Demo 2: Remote State Setup (7 min) ⭐ CRITICAL
**This MUST run first - creates backend for demos 3-6**

```bash
cd demo-02-remote-state-setup
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

# Show outputs - copy storage account name
terraform output
```

**✨ Important Notes:**
- Storage account will have a random suffix (e.g., `tfstateXXXXXX`)
- Copy the storage account name from outputs
- This storage account is used by all remaining demos
- **Azure AD auth is pre-configured** (no access keys needed)

**After Apply:**
- Show the storage account in Azure Portal
- Show the container named `tfstate`
- Explain versioning is enabled
- **Leave this deployed** - needed for demos 3-6

---

### Demo 3: VNet with Remote State (8 min)

```bash
cd demo-03-vnet-remote-state

# Check backend.hcl has correct storage account name
cat backend.hcl

# Initialize with remote backend
terraform init -backend-config=backend.hcl

# Plan and apply
terraform plan
terraform apply

# Show remote state
terraform output
```

**Key Points:**
- Backend is configured in backend.hcl
- State is stored remotely (not local)
- Azure AD authentication (no keys needed)
- Show state file in Azure Portal storage account

**Optional:** Keep this deployed or destroy:
```bash
terraform destroy  # If you want to clean up
```

---

### Demo 4: Advanced Features (10 min)
**Focus: locals.tf, tfvars, multi-environment**

```bash
cd demo-04-advanced-features

# Show the files
cat locals.tf      # ⭐ Main teaching point
cat dev.tfvars
cat uat.tfvars
cat prod.tfvars

# Initialize with DEV backend
terraform init -backend-config=backend-dev.hcl

# Plan with DEV variables
terraform plan -var-file=dev.tfvars

# Apply (optional)
terraform apply -var-file=dev.tfvars

# Show outputs
terraform output
```

**🎤 Teaching Points:**
1. **locals.tf** - Separation of concerns
   - Environment configurations
   - CIDR calculations
   - Conditional logic
   - Tag standardization

2. **tfvars** - Same code, different configs
   - dev.tfvars (small resources)
   - uat.tfvars (medium resources)
   - prod.tfvars (large resources)

3. **Multiple backends** - Separate state per environment
   - backend-dev.hcl
   - backend-uat.hcl
   - backend-prod.hcl

**Demo Different Environment:**
```bash
# Clean up dev
terraform destroy -var-file=dev.tfvars

# Switch to UAT
terraform init -backend-config=backend-uat.hcl -reconfigure
terraform plan -var-file=uat.tfvars
```

---

### Demo 5: Custom Modules (12 min)

```bash
cd demo-05-custom-modules

# Show module structure
ls -la ../modules/
tree ../modules/foundation/resource-group/  # If tree is installed

# Show module usage
cat main.tf | grep "module \""

# Initialize
terraform init -backend-config=backend.hcl

# Plan
terraform plan

# Apply (optional - this creates multiple resources)
terraform apply

# Show outputs
terraform output
```

**Key Points:**
- Reusable modules in `../modules/`
- Consistent naming and tagging
- Modules used:
  - Resource Group
  - Virtual Network
  - Key Vault
  - Storage Account
  - Private DNS Zone
- Show how one module call creates many resources

**Cleanup:**
```bash
terraform destroy  # This will take a few minutes
```

---

### Demo 6: Azure Verified Modules (8 min)
**Educational focus - validation only**

```bash
cd demo-06-azure-verified-modules

# Show README with AVM information
cat README.md

# Validate configuration
terraform init -backend-config=backend.hcl
terraform validate

# Optional: Show plan
terraform plan
```

**🎤 Teaching Points:**
1. What are Azure Verified Modules (AVM)?
   - Microsoft-verified
   - Production-ready
   - Best practices built-in
   - Compliance-ready

2. Where to find them:
   - https://aka.ms/avm
   - Terraform Registry
   - GitHub repositories

3. Benefits:
   - Reduced development time
   - Proven patterns
   - Regular updates
   - Community support

4. When to use:
   - Production deployments
   - Enterprise requirements
   - Compliance needs
   - Complex scenarios

**Note:** This demo uses standard resources for reliability, but the README provides full AVM education

## 🎯 Quick Reference Commands

### Initialize with Backend
```bash
terraform init -backend-config=backend.hcl
```

### Plan with Variables
```bash
terraform plan -var-file=dev.tfvars
```

### Apply
```bash
terraform apply                    # Will prompt
terraform apply -auto-approve      # No prompt (careful!)
```

### Show Outputs
```bash
terraform output                   # All outputs
terraform output storage_account   # Specific output
```

### Destroy
```bash
terraform destroy                  # Will prompt
terraform destroy -auto-approve    # No prompt (careful!)
```

### Format Code
```bash
terraform fmt                      # Current directory
terraform fmt -recursive           # All subdirectories
```

### Validate
```bash
terraform validate                 # Check syntax
```

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

### 1. Demo 2 MUST Run First
Demos 3-6 depend on the storage account created in Demo 2

### 2. Azure AD Authentication is Pre-Configured
- No access keys needed
- Uses your `az login` credentials
- Storage Blob Data Contributor role will be assigned automatically on first use

### 3. Time Management
- Total demos: ~50 minutes
- Leave 10 minutes for Q&A
- Can skip Demo 6 if running short (it's educational only)

### 4. Cleanup Between Demos
Decide beforehand:
- Keep resources to show in Portal? (costs minimal $)
- Destroy after each demo? (cleaner, but takes time)

### 5. Backup Plan
If something fails:
- Have screenshots ready
- Can show validation instead of apply
- Can skip to next demo
